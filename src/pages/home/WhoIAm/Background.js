            <p>
                Hailing from Pakistan, my roots are firmly grounded in a family of engineers â€“ a lineage of problem solvers. My father, an aeronautical engineer, and my brother, a full-stack software engineer, have been my guiding lights. While our socioeconomic status may be considered below middle class, I embrace it without allowing it to define me, for it is not where I start but where I aspire to reach.
