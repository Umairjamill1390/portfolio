            <p>
                The spark of curiosity ignited within me early on, pondering the intricacies of the internet and the magic behind a mouse click. This early fascination laid the foundation for my journey into the world of technology. Motivated by the dream of transforming the aspirations of my family into reality, I am on a quest to become a full-stack software engineer, ready to unravel the mysteries of code.
